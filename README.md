# Smart Door Lock System

This project implements a smart door lock system using Arduino, a keypad, a servo motor, and an LCD display.  
It allows users to set and reset passwords, lock and unlock the door, and provides visual feedback on the LCD screen.

## Features

- **Password Protection**: Set and reset the password using the keypad.
- **Lock/Unlock Mechanism**: Control the servo motor to lock or unlock the door.
- **LCD Display**: Provides real-time status updates and instructions.
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access by requiring the correct password.

## Components Required

- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad
- Servo Motor
- 16x2 LCD Display (compatible with Adafruit_LiquidCrystal library)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
